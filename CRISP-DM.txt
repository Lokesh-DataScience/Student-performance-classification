#### **1. Business Understanding**

- **Project Name: Student Performance Predictor**
  
- **Business Objective: Student's performance is much very important in overall area growth so better performance of student's is need to be predicted.**  

- **Data Mining Objective: We are going to predict where a student is performing well or not.**  

- **Success Criteria: 
	- The project will be considered successful if the model can predict student performance with an accuracy of at least 85%.
	- Additionally, the model should show robust performance on key evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly in identifying students at risk of low performance.
	- Success will also be measured by the ability of the model to provide actionable insights, such as identifying the most significant factors influencing student performance (e.g., study time, parental education, etc.).
	- The final model should be easy to interpret and deploy, enabling educators or stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to improve student outcomes.**  

- **Key Stakeholders: Currently only me.**
